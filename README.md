# blazoraccounting
Web based pre-accounting system using c# Blazor .NET7, MS SQL Server, EntityFrameWork, Linq


Our project, developed using .Net Core, EF Core, DevExpress, Abp Framework and Linq, demonstrates how to create interactive websites using only C# code without having to use Javascript. We will create custom components, integrate different components and use DevExpress Blazor components in projects. AbpFramework is utilized both in the back-end and partially in UI for this project. The project includes features like DDD, authentication, authorization, localization, and AOP. The open-source and free AbpFramework provides many structures for the back-end, which were customized for the project's needs.
